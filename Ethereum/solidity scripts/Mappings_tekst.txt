MAPPINGS

* Mappings are "Key-Value" STORAGE.
* Also known as 'dictionary' in other programming languages.
* mapping(key type => value type)name;
* mapping(address => uint)balance


*Example Balance mapping:

    *  Key - Value
    *  address -> balance

    // Create a mapping between address and balance.
    *  mapping(address => uint)balance;

    // Initiate a value to the address.
    *  balance[address] = 20;

    // This calls the address to get the balance.
    *  balance[address];
